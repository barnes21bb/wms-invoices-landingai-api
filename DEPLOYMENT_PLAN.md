# Business Deployment Plan - Invoice Processing Tool

## What This Tool Will Become
This tool will be used by your company's employees to:
1. **View** a list of invoices that have already been processed
2. **Compare** the original PDF invoice with the data that was automatically extracted
3. **Edit** any mistakes in the extracted data
4. **Save** corrected data to your company's database (Snowflake)

Think of it like a quality control station where people can review and fix the computer's work.

## Current vs. Future State

### What We Have Now âœ…
- A system that can read invoice PDFs and extract data automatically
- A basic web page where someone can upload one file at a time
- The extracted data appears on screen
- Everything works locally on one computer

### What We Need to Build ðŸ”§

#### 1. **Database Connection (High Priority)**
**What it is:** Connect the tool to your company's Snowflake database
**Why we need it:** Currently, extracted data disappears when you close the app. We need to save it permanently.
**What this means:** 
- All invoice data will be stored in tables in Snowflake
- Multiple people can access the same data
- Data persists between sessions
- Can generate reports and analytics

#### 2. **Invoice Management System (High Priority)**
**What it is:** A way to see all processed invoices in one place
**Why we need it:** Users need to browse and select which invoices to review
**What this means:**
- Main page shows a table/list of all invoices
- Users can filter by date, vendor, amount, etc.
- Click on any invoice to view details
- Show processing status (new, reviewed, approved, etc.)

#### 3. **Data Editing Interface (High Priority)**
**What it is:** Forms where users can correct extracted data
**Why we need it:** AI isn't perfect - humans need to fix mistakes
**What this means:**
- Side-by-side view: PDF on left, editable form on right
- Click on any field to edit it
- Highlight differences from original extraction
- Save button to update the database
- Track who made changes and when

#### 4. **User Access Control (Medium Priority)**
**What it is:** Login system and permissions
**Why we need it:** Control who can view/edit invoices
**What this means:**
- Simple login screen
- Different user roles (viewer, editor, admin)
- Track who did what for audit purposes

#### 5. **File Upload & Processing (Medium Priority)**
**What it is:** Better way to add new invoices
**Why we need it:** Currently can only process one file at a time
**What this means:**
- Drag-and-drop multiple files
- Automatic processing in background
- Progress indicators
- Email notifications when processing is complete

## Technical Changes Needed

### New Components to Build

#### 1. **Database Layer**
- Create tables in Snowflake for:
  - Invoice headers (customer, date, amount, etc.)
  - Invoice line items (individual charges)
  - Processing audit log (who changed what when)
- Build connection code to read/write data

#### 2. **Updated Web Interface**
Current app is a simple upload page. New app needs:
- **Dashboard:** List of all invoices with search/filter
- **Detail View:** Side-by-side PDF viewer and edit form
- **Admin Panel:** User management and system settings

#### 3. **File Storage System**
- Store PDF files somewhere accessible (cloud storage)
- Keep track of which PDF goes with which database record
- Handle file security and access permissions

#### 4. **Background Processing**
- Process multiple files automatically
- Queue system for large batches
- Error handling and retry logic

### Files That Need Major Changes

#### 1. **app.py (Streamlit Interface)**
- **Current:** Simple upload and view page
- **Needs to become:** Multi-page application with:
  - Invoice list/dashboard page
  - Individual invoice review page
  - Admin/settings page
  - User login page

#### 2. **batch_processor.py**
- **Current:** Processes files and shows results on screen
- **Needs to become:** Processes files and saves to database
- Add database connection code
- Add error handling for database operations

#### 3. **New Files Needed:**
- `database.py` - Snowflake connection and queries
- `models.py` - Database table definitions
- `auth.py` - User login and permissions
- `file_storage.py` - Handle PDF file storage

## Deployment Considerations

### Where Will This Run?
**Current:** Runs on your local computer
**Future Options:**
1. **Cloud Platform (Recommended):** AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud
2. **Company Server:** Internal server if your company has one
3. **Streamlit Cloud:** Simple hosting but limited database options

### What About Security?
- **Database Access:** Secure connection to Snowflake with proper credentials
- **File Storage:** Encrypted storage for sensitive invoice PDFs
- **User Access:** Login system to control who can see what
- **Audit Trail:** Track all changes for compliance

### How Many Users?
- Current system: 1 user at a time
- New system: Multiple users simultaneously
- Need to handle concurrent editing (what happens if two people edit the same invoice?)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Database Foundation (4-6 weeks)
1. Set up Snowflake tables
2. Build database connection code
3. Update processing to save data
4. Basic invoice list view

### Phase 2: User Interface (3-4 weeks)
1. Build invoice dashboard
2. Create edit interface
3. Add PDF viewer
4. Implement save/update functionality

### Phase 3: User Management (2-3 weeks)
1. Add login system
2. Implement user roles
3. Add audit logging

### Phase 4: Production Features (2-3 weeks)
1. File upload improvements
2. Error handling
3. Performance optimization
4. Documentation and training

## Questions to Consider

1. **How many people will use this tool daily?**
   - Affects server requirements and database design

2. **What approval workflow do you need?**
   - Should edited invoices require manager approval?
   - Who can make final changes?

3. **How do you want to handle file storage?**
   - Keep PDFs forever or delete after processing?
   - Where should they be stored securely?

4. **Integration with existing systems?**
   - Does this need to connect to your accounting software?
   - Export data to other systems?

5. **Backup and disaster recovery?**
   - How often should data be backed up?
   - What happens if the system goes down?

This plan transforms your current prototype into a production business tool that multiple people can use safely and efficiently.
